# Automated and Explainable Data Cleaning Using Hybrid AI and LLM

**Final Year Project (FYP)**
**Academic Year**: 2024/2025

## Overview

This research project develops an intelligent data cleaning system that combines rule-based logic, machine learning, and large language models (LLMs) to automatically detect, correct, and explain data quality issues in tabular datasets.

## Research Objectives

- Evaluate the effectiveness of hybrid approaches (Rule + ML + LLM) for automated data cleaning
- Assess the quality of LLM-generated explanations for cleaning decisions
- Analyze the cost-effectiveness tradeoff of LLM integration in data pipelines

## Scope

**Data Quality Issues** (4 types):
- Missing values
- Duplicate rows
- Outliers
- Data type inconsistencies

**Methods**:
- Baseline A: Rule-based cleaning
- Baseline B: Rule + ML
- Proposed: Rule + ML + LLM explanations

**Datasets**: 4-5 benchmark datasets (UCI/Kaggle + synthetic)

## Timeline
